# Elastic-PPQ
An Autonomic System to Support Elastic Parallel Preference Queries on Multi-Core Architectures

This framework is an extension of BT-PPQ. In addition to burst-tolerant scheduling strategies, the framework supports elasiticty mechanisms able to dynamically change the parallelism level of the system. The whole adaptation logic is programmed by a Fuzzy Logic Controller.

The code requires FastFlow 2.1 (http://calvados.di.unipi.it/) and FuzzyLite 5 (http://www.fuzzylite.com/cpp/).
